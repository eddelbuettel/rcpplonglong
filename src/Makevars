## We want C++11 as it gets us 'long long' as well
## If we uncomment this we fall back to C++98 and it is all tears
CXX_STD = CXX11

## Alternatively, just use C++11 options (where available) for standard C++
## compiler.  This brings 'long long' (from both C99 and C++2003) in with
## most compilers as either the C++0x or C++11 standard will get pulled in.
